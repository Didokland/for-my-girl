    qonaqTitle: "The Philosophy of Qonaq (Қонақ)",
    qonaqDefinition: "In Kazakh culture, a guest — qonaq — is believed to be sent directly by God (Qonaq — Qudaidyn elshisi). According to ancient nomadic tradition, when a traveler arrives from the infinite steppe, the host family observes the sacred rule of Qonaqasy: providing generous nourishment, clean bedding, hot tea, and total protection for up to three days without ever asking the guest’s name, tribe, or purpose of travel.",
    hospitalityText: "This profound code was forged in the vast Central Asian plains, where vast distances between human settlements meant hospitality was not merely an etiquette, but a matter of human survival. Today, whether you arrive in a gleaming glass-and-steel cafe in Almaty, a high-speed Talgo train across the Saryarka steppe, or an adobe teahouse in ancient Turkestan, you are treated not as a commercial consumer, but as an honored guest."
